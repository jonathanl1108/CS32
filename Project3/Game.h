    // Play the game. Display the progress of the game in a manner of your choosing, provided that someone looking at the screen can follow what's happening. If neither player is interactive, then to keep the display from quickly scrolling through the whole game, it would be reasonable periodically to prompt the viewer to press ENTER to continue and not proceed until ENTER is pressed. (The ignore function for input streams is useful here.) Announce the winner at the end of the game. You can apportion to your liking the responsibility for displaying the board between this function and the move function. (Note: If when this function is called, South has no beans in play, so can't make the first move, sweep any beans on the North side into North's pot and act as if the game is thus over.)
